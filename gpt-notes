# GPT Notes: Templates for Requesting Help from LLM Models

## Purpose
This document provides structured templates to help you communicate effectively with LLM models (like GPT) when requesting assistance with bash scripts and other code-related tasks. Using these templates ensures clear context, precise requirements, and better results.

## General Guidelines
1. **Always specify the context**: Mention the operating system, shell, and any relevant environment details.
2. **Reference specific files**: When asking about existing code, provide the file paths and relevant excerpts.
3. **Be explicit about constraints**: State what should not be changed or what must be preserved.
4. **Define the desired outcome**: Clearly explain what you want the code to accomplish.
5. **Request step-by-step explanations when needed**: Ask for reasoning behind changes.

## Template for Generating New Bash Scripts

### Basic Template
```
Context:
- OS: [e.g., Ubuntu 22.04]
- Shell: [e.g., bash 5.1]
- Working directory: [e.g., /home/user/project/scripts]
- Constraints: [e.g., must be POSIX-compliant, no external dependencies]

Request:
Generate a bash script that [describe the script's purpose].

Requirements:
1. [Specific requirement 1]
2. [Specific requirement 2]
3. [Include error handling, logging, etc.]

Deliverables:
- The complete script code
- Brief explanation of key parts
- Usage instructions
```

### Advanced Template (with existing codebase)
```
Context:
- OS: [Linux distribution and version]
- Shell: [bash/zsh version]
- Project structure: [brief description]
- Relevant existing files: [list file paths with their purposes]

Current Situation:
[Describe what you have and what's not working or what you want to add]

Request:
Generate/modify a bash script to [specific goal].

Requirements:
1. Must integrate with existing files: [list files]
2. Must follow patterns used in: [reference specific patterns]
3. Must not modify: [list files or sections to preserve]
4. Must include: [specific features like argument parsing, logging, etc.]

Deliverables:
- SEARCH/REPLACE blocks for all modified files
- New file contents if creating from scratch
- Explanation of changes
- Testing instructions
```

## Template for Modifying Existing Bash Scripts

```
Context:
- File to modify: [full path]
- Current purpose: [what the script does]
- Related files: [list with purposes]

Current Issue/Improvement Needed:
[Describe the problem or enhancement]

Request:
Modify the script to [specific change] while preserving [what must stay the same].

Requirements:
1. Change only [specific parts]
2. Maintain compatibility with [dependencies or other scripts]
3. Add/update [specific features]
4. Follow existing code style: [mention style if any]

Deliverables:
- SEARCH/REPLACE block for the modified file
- Explanation of each change
- Impact on related functionality
```

## Template for Debugging Bash Scripts

```
Context:
- Script location: [full path]
- Error encountered: [paste error message]
- Steps to reproduce: [detailed steps]
- Environment: [OS, shell version, relevant variables]

Current Script (relevant portion):
```bash
[paste the problematic code section]
```

Request:
Identify and fix the issue in the script.

Requirements:
1. Preserve the overall script structure
2. Explain the root cause
3. Provide the corrected code
4. Suggest preventive measures for similar issues

Deliverables:
- Corrected code section
- Root cause analysis
- Prevention tips
```

## Template for Code Review

```
Context:
- Script location: [full path]
- Script purpose: [brief description]
- Target audience: [who will use/maintain it]

Request:
Perform a code review of this bash script.

Focus Areas:
1. Security best practices
2. Performance optimizations
3. Error handling robustness
4. Code readability and maintainability
5. Portability concerns

Deliverables:
- List of issues found (categorized by severity)
- Specific recommendations for each issue
- Code examples for fixes
- Overall assessment
```

## Example: Requesting a New Backup Script

```
Context:
- OS: Ubuntu 22.04
- Shell: bash 5.1
- Working directory: ~/scripts/
- Constraints: Must use rsync, include logging, and support dry-run mode

Request:
Generate a bash script for backing up a directory to a remote server.

Requirements:
1. Accept source and destination as arguments
2. Include --dry-run option to preview changes
3. Log all operations to /var/log/backup.log
4. Send email notification on completion (optional)
5. Include proper error handling

Deliverables:
- Complete backup.sh script
- Usage examples
- Explanation of key functions
```

## Important Notes
- **Always verify generated code** before executing in production environments
- **Test thoroughly** in a safe environment first
- **Provide feedback** to improve future interactions
- **Update these templates** as you discover better communication patterns

## When Providing Files to LLM
1. Share only relevant portions of code
2. Include surrounding context when necessary
3. Mention file permissions and execution requirements
4. Specify any dependencies or prerequisites
```

This template collection helps ensure that requests to LLMs are structured, complete, and yield the most useful results while avoiding unintended modifications.
